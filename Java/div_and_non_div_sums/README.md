# ðŸ’¼ Divisible and Non-divisible Sums Difference<a name="about-project"></a>
You are given positive integers n and m.<br>
Define two integers, num1 and num2, as follows:<br>

num1: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] that are not divisible by m.<br>
num2: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] that are divisible by m.<br>
Return the integer num1 - num2.
<br><br>

Example 1: <br>
Input: n = 10, m = 3 <br>
Output: 19 <br>

# ðŸ“œ Plan/Problems
1. Create 2 lists to store divisible and non-divisible numbers.
2. Create a while loop to get and store the values.
3. Create another loop to add the non-divisible values.
4. Create another loop to subtract the divisible values.
5. Return total.
