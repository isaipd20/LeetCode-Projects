Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i]).
<br>
Return the running sum of nums.
<br><br>

Example 1:
<br>
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4] <br>
Output: [1,3,6,10] <br>
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

# 📜 Plan/Problems
