# ðŸ’¼ Jewels and Stones<a name="about-project"></a>
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. <br>
Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
<br>
Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
<br><br> 

Example 1:
<br><br>
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"<br>
Output: 3

# ðŸ“œ Plan/Problems
