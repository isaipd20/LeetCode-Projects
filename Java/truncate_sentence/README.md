# ðŸ’¼ Truncate Sentence<a name="about-project"></a>
A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. <br>
Each of the words consists of only uppercase and lowercase English letters (no punctuation). 
<br><br>

For example, "Hello World", "HELLO", and "hello world hello world" are all sentences. <br>
You are given a sentence sâ€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ and an integer kâ€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹. You want to truncate sâ€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ such that it contains only the first kâ€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ words. Return sâ€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ after truncating it.

# ðŸ“œ Plan/Problems
1. Create a string with no value.
2. Create a loop that iterates through the given string.
3. Start counting the number of spaces.
4. If the number of spaces is equal to the integer k, then break.
5. Else, add each character to the string.
7. return strung.
