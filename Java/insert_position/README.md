Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
<br>
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
<br><br>
Example:
<br>
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2

# 📜 Plan/Problems
1. Create a loop where it iterates through a list.
2. Check if the current value of list is greater than the target value.
3. If the current value is greater than the target value, save position.
4. Create a new list with new length.
5. Insert the target value in the position from previous list.
