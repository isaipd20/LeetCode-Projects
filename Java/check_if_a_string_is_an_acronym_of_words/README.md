# ðŸ’¼ Check if a String Is an Acronym of Words<a name="about-project"></a>
Given an array of strings words and a string s, determine if s is an acronym of words.
<br>
The string s is considered an acronym of words if it can be formed by concatenating the first character of each string in words in order.<br>

Return true if s is an acronym of words, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
<br>
Input: words = ["alice","bob","charlie"], s = "abc" <br>
Output: true
