# 💼 Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer<a name="about-project"></a>
Given an integer number n, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.
<br><br>

Example 1:
<br>
Input: n = 234<br>
Output: 15 <br><br>
Explanation: <br>
Product of digits = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 <br>
Sum of digits = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 <br>
Result = 24 - 9 = 15

# 📜 Plan/Problems
1. Create a loop to get every number of the int.
2. Multiply and add that number to the corresponding sum.
3. The result will be the sum of mul every number minus the sum of adding the nums.
4. Return the result.
