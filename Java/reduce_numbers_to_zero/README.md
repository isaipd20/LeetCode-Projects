# 💼 Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero<a name="about-project"></a>
Given an integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.
<br>
In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.
<br><br>

Example 1:
<br>
Input: num = 14 <br>
Output: 6

# 📜 Plan/Problems
1. Create a loop that ends when the original number is 0.
2. If the number is even, then we divided by 2.
3. If the number is odd, then we subtract 1 to that number.
4. Return number of steps took to reach 0.
