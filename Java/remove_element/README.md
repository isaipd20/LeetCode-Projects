Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. <br>
Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val. <br><br>

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:<br><br>

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums. <br>
Return k. <br><br>

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3 <br>
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]

# ðŸ“œ Plan/Problems
